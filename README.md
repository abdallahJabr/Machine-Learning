# Machine-Learning
A repository that contains my work in Machine Learning for the past 5 months. The Jupyter notebooks start from processing and visualzing
datasets then move to the concepts of linear regression, support vector machines, principal component analysis, backpropagation, the multi-
layer perceptron, convolutional neural networks, and then recurrent neural networks. I hope this work is useful and that you enjoy it.
